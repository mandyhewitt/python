Documentation Overview
----------------------

We are currently working to improve documentation for Python. This is an ongoing challenge.

At present the main resources are as follows:
  * A draft version of a cookbook which describes how to install and
    update Python and run a first model
  * A ReadTheDocs repository which gives information about all of the input parameters
  * A pydocs repository which provides information about the python scripts contained in
    $PYTHON/py_progs
  * A Doxygen repositiory, which provides information about the source code.

We are working on a reference guide and we are working on adding
Doxygen comments for the code.
